TO DO:

1. Allow bot to play itself. Set up a second simulate script with alternate
parameters. This way we can optimize the parameters!

2. Improve the stats printout to show how the scoring works. 

3. Get this shitty simulate function working.
Honestly ever since I separated everything it's such a pain to troubleshoot.

I need to be able to see the dataframe from the last move. And that 
needs to have the broken down score.

implement check
implement pawn transform
get pawn transform into score
implement black first view
