TO DO:

1. Allow bot to play itself. Set up a second simulate script with alternate
parameters. This way we can optimize the parameters!

2. Flavor text. :)

3. Fix endgame AI. It's terrible.

4. Add no moving into check.

5. Add stalemate.

6. Just make the AI better in general.

7. Fix AI pawn promotion.

8. Figure out what's going on in the error when the enemy puts you in check.
