TO DO:

1. Allow bot to play itself. Set up a second simulate script with alternate
parameters. This way we can optimize the parameters!

2. Flavor text. :)

3. Fix endgame AI. It's terrible.
  3a. Perhaps fix the simulate function to be recursive,
  then in endgame, we can "recur" more times due to fewer moves. :)
